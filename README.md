# todo....
a simple todo list.

So this is a simple todlist program in C.

You are supposed to be able to compile the three seperate files, todoadd, tododel and todolist with todo.c, and you'll be able to edit
things in your list.

The only file that needs to be edited for the list to work is todo.c which is currently missing 6 pre-defined functions, 
in order to complete the list.
